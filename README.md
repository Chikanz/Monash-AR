# AR Navigation and Monash Wheel Wright Experience
This is a fork based from mapbox-ar-unity which provided a framework for world scale AR navigation. You can find out more about how that works [here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ar-unity).

This repo has a series of features including:
- Experimenting with different methods of navigating people in world space AR via transforming GPS coordinates to objects in local space
- Simulating real time sun positioning using [this](http://guideving.blogspot.com.au/2010/08/sun-position-in-c.html) code and translating that to lighting in AR
- A proof of concept building interface that could be used as a novel way of detailing what facilities are on each floor or for exploring information and video in an AR space
- Prefabs for displaying information on a cube or billboard
- A short experience that steps the user through the [wheelwright's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelwright) process of putting a tyre on a wheel in AR. [You can find out more about that here](https://www.notion.so/Monash-AR-experience-storyboard-2720e77d45a440f9a87005cac710cd6b)



Here's a diagram showing how all the different frameworks fit together in Unity:
